                                Three Minute Thesis is a research communication competition that requires contestants
                                to condense their research into a three-minute, one-slide presentation for a non-specialist audience. <br>
                                There is no limit on how many candidates can register for this event. The review panel which is
                                consisted of the faculty members will review the submissions. Candidates selected by the panel
                                will be sent an approval mail. Then they will be required to confirm the payment before deadline,
                                which will be notified to them with the approval mail.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The University of Queensland (UQ), 3MT competition cultivates students’ academic,
                                presentation, and research communication skills. Presenting in a 3MT competition increases
                                their capacity to effectively explain their research in three minutes, in a language
                                appropriate to a non-specialist audience.
                            </p>
                            <h5>History</h5>
                            <p>
                                The idea for the Three Minute Thesis (3MT®) competition came about at a time when
                                the state of Queensland was suffering severe drought. To conserve water, residents were
                                encouraged to time their showers, and many people had a three-minute egg timer fixed to
                                the wall in their bathroom. The then Dean of the UQ Graduate School,
                                Emeritus Professor Alan Lawson, put two and two together and the idea for the 3MT competition was born.
                            </p>

                            <h5>How will I be judged?</h5>
                            <p>
                                The presentations are judged by a diverse panel of judges from a range of disciplines.
                                The exact composition varies each year, but we always make sure they are experienced academics.
                                It is unlikely that they will be experts in your field, so they are also part of the ‘intelligent,
                                lay audience’ which is at the core of 3MT®. The panel chooses the winner and the runner up in the competition. <br>
                                There is also a People’s Choice award, where each audience member votes for their favorite. We always encourage
                                the audience to be impartial and follow the criteria outlined on the next page. <br>
                                The judging criteria center on four key sections: <strong>Comprehension</strong>,
                                <strong>Content</strong>, <strong>Engagement</strong> and <strong>Communication</strong>
                                and should be the focus of your presentation.

                                A programming contest generally involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical problems
                                to the contestants and contestants are required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem.
                                Judging is based mostly upon a number of problems solved and time spent on writing successful solutions,
                                but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, program size, etc.)
